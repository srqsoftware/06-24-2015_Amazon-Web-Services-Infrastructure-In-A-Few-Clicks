# Amazon Web Services Infrastructure in a Few Click by Travis Carlson 


## Abstract

Amazon Web Services (AWS) makes it easy for developers to set up and administer their own infrastructure (servers, file systems, databases, etc.) using a straightforward web console and/or command-line client. This presentation will give an introduction to using AWS and demo how to create a basic infrastructure in just a few clicks, schedule common operations tasks such as backups using a simple command line script, set up monitors and alerts to keep things running smoothly, and easily scale up the infrastructure to handle heavier workloads.
